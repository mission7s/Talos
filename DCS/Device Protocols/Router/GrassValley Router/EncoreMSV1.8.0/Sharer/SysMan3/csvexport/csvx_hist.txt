1) Copy "csvx.exe" and "csvxprmpt" to a floppy disk. The floppy
disk should be formatted for the native FS of the drive you will
install from.
2) Rename "csvx.exe" to "omn_ix86" for Intel System Manager or omnalpha for Alpha System Manager.
3) Rename "csvxprmpt" to "omnprmpt".
4) Do the equivalent of "dir /b a:\ > a:\omnlist" for your OS. RISCOS - use "EnumDir :0.$ :a0.$.omnlist"
5) Put the floppy in the floppy drive of your OUI, the System Manager 3
engine, or the Sharer.
6) Select the relevent button from the System Manager 3 Install screen.
