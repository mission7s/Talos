Installs fonts into the OmniBus database.

1) Copy "font.exe" and "fontprmpt" to a floppy disk. The floppy
disk should be formatted for the native FS of the drive you will
install from.
2) Rename "font.exe" to "omn_ix86" for Intel System Manager or "omnalpha" for Alpha System Manager.
3) Rename "fontprmpt" to "omnprmpt".
4) Copy the fonts files to the disk. The font files traditionally come on a floppy in folders
(e.g. "a:\fonts\banka\font01"). They should be placed in the root directory of the disk
(e.g. "a:\font01").
5) Do the equivalent of "dir /b a:\ > a:\omnlist" for your OS. (RISCOS use "EnumDir :0.$ :0.$.omnlist")
6) Put the floppy in the floppy drive of your OUI, the System Manager 3
engine, or the Sharer.
7) Select the relevent button from the System Manager 3 Install screen.
