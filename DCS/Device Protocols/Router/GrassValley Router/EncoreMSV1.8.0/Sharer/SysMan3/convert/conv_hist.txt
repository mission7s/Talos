Please read the Sharer manual chapter on upgrading System Manager databases.
A brief summary is presented here.

0) Upgrade to Sharer 3.60. Enable System Manager 3.60. Back up 
all data in \omn\sysdat.

1) Copy "conv.exe" and "convprmpt" to a floppy disk. The floppy
disk should be formatted for the native FS of the drive you will
install from.
2) Rename "conv.exe" to "omn_ix86" for Intel System Manager or "omnalpha" for Alpha system managers.
3) Rename "convprmpt" to "omnprmpt".
4) Do the equivalent of "dir /b a:\ > a:\omnlist" for your OS. For RISCOS use "enumdir :0.$ :0.$.omnlist"
5) Put the floppy in the floppy drive of your OUI, the System Manager 3
engine, or the Sharer.
6) Select the relevent button from the System Manager 3 Install screen.

Finally) Go through each engine, checking the engines have the correct 
applications available. Send the logfile from the floppy disk to Omnibus 
Support for checking.
