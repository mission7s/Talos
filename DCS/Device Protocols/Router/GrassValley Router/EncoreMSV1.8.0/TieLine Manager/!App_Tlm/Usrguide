Ensure tielines are configured in router config if not then
===========================================================

Configure sources and destinations with the same ID Name at the tieline endpoints
Set the type of source/Destination to be System_tieline.
Modify the Router Databases
                           
Either repower the tlm app or in the system menu selectivly reload the databases
by listing the areas and selecting the required ones.

===========================================================
 
Directions.
After RePower Wait at least 1 Min the database loading has been changed to stop too much data overpowering the
tx buffers

Log On
    Enter the Tie config Menu
	Enter the Status Menu
    Enter the Browse Menu
    
A list of tielines active on the net will appear
Go back to Tie Config Menu
Use the '<' & '>' keys or List Tieline functions to
scan through the tieline database you have just browsed
To be able to use a tieline you must change its state from offline
Click Ref. Name to name the tie line
When Happy with the config Use Save to save the config settings

When reactivating after a reboot/powerdown it is only neccessary to Use Load in the config menu
You dont need to browse unless any more tielines have been set up on the system

---------------------
Tieline Status in config menu

'Available' means the tlm has seen both src and dst for the tieline so it may be routed to
'In Use' - Indicates if the Tie Line is in use
'Dest User' Shows the current Top Owner of the tieline segment  (ie the destination (monitor etc) using the tieline)
  Click this for a list of sharers
'Final Src.'Shows the source that exists at the end of the whole tieline path (including other segments if they are routed to this one)
'Router Src'Shows the current src routed to THIS segments input
'Route Dest.'Shows the 1st user of this tieline segments Output
*****NEW V0.08***** - Click this to show a list of all dests watching this src....

Reserved / Fixed /Floating - Tieline types
Floating       - Implemented and tested
Fixed/Reserved - Implemented and tested
Param pops up a dst.src for reserved/fixed tl types.

Ref Name - The router Src/Dest Id as setup in the router database

Src/Dest areas - Obvious

------------------------
Using it

Goto 'ROUTE MENU'

Select a router source and destination using 'Route Source' and 'Route Dest'

To Try and FIND a path use 'Find Path' This will prompt if no path is possible
  If a path can be found it will be displayed in the Slats to the left of the screen
  The slats grow up from the bottom of the screen.
  The bottom of the screen is towards the destination.
  Slats show the tieline segment to be used and its status should you use it.
  Status is:
    Exclus :-you will have exclusive use of this tieline segment
    Shared :- You will be sharing this segment with someone else
    Owner  :- You already own this tieline segment
    ShResv :- You will share a reserved tieline (this may be taken by the reservee without notice)

To Make this path use 'Make Path'
   This will connect the routes as shown in the status
   You dont need to do 'Find Path' first -its just a nice diagnostic.
   
If you click on the Slats at a valid location :-
   Extra Status can be obtained - this pops up a config status screen giving data similar to the config menu
   
   If you are only finding the path this may not tally until you make the path.
   'Final Source' is a full tally Back from the system so you can check the
   route on the tlm.
 
Options - 'Exclusive'      - Form an exclusive path only (Do not share)**

'Find Source'    - Walks the databases to find the current final source for the current dest.
    
-------------------------------
Current Logic      

You get a new tieline for every destination User -Unless the dest wants a source already available
  in which case it will share the tieline**.
Tieline now has a list of users so when a user releases or trys to make another tieline the other sharers
will keep the tieline and the orig user will try for a new one***
If there are no more tl's you are told.At this point the user still logged to its previous tieline

When you change a destinations source that was using a tieline it releases its ownership
  and tries from scratch to make a tieline.

------------------------------
System Menu

Config in System Screen
 a/'Share Reserved' - Allow tielines to be shared if they have correct src available for others
 b/'Polite Mode'    - Top User cannot break a tieline in use (Shared by others)***
 c/'Release all'    - Release all users ownership of tielines

Overrides
Release Users - Remove all users from all tie lines
Disable Messages - Disable 'No path..' messages from network requests for tie lines
Disable TLM - Remove TLM from the network

------------------------------
