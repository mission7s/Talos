Installing and Running the Xitami Web Server
(FTP Daemon), Console Version

October 20, 1999

This FTP Daemon (Installed in the user choosen
directory) allows the SMS7000 MCPU to boot over 
Ethernet or SLIP, from the Win95 or NT PC. 
This is also used to load large files over the
ethernet to the MCPU such as:
sms
fl.mot
eMtrx.bin
eMtrxA.bin
eMtrxB.bin
Mtrx.bin
MtrxA.bin
MtrxB.bin
MtrxS.bin
MtrxSA.bin
MtrxSB.bin

Example of its use is loading the SMS7500 
AES router. Use the SMS7000 MCPU terminal
interface to type the following command:

> prog "PC:\MtrxS.bin" nc nmc

(This will load both the MtrxSA.bin and 
MtrxSB.bin files.)

Installing:
	
When Installing the Xitami software please 
follow these instructions:
	Select the default install directory. 
	Select the default Program Manager Group.
	Select 'No, I'll start it when I need it'.
	Leave the name and password blank.
	Select 'Tiny - never block another task'.
	Finally select 'Finish' (rather than 
	"run it now").
	
Two FTPD configuration files are provided 
(defaults.cfg and ftpusers.sms) located on the
CD-ROM in /ftpd/config directory. 
The Install program will copy these files into
the Xitami web server directory for you if you
select the 'Configure FTP Daemon' option after 
installing the Xitami program.  
If you are installing the web server on your own 
(i.e., not within the SMS7000 Install Procedure) 
you should copy these files there yourself.

The PC's IP address is set to 192.0.2.1 as a 
default. This can be changed by editing the file
defaults.cfg and updating the IP address.


Running:
	
You will probably only want to run the FTP Daemon 
when you are booting the MCPU from the PC (i.e., 
loading new MCPU code from the PC).
	
The FTP Daemon (Console version) can be launched 
by Start->Programs->Internet Tools->Xitami Web 
Server, or from Windows Explorer.
	
Be forewarned that you cannot type anything into 
the console and that it	does not show any useful 
information.
	
When done booting the MCPU, you can stop the FTP
Daemon by hitting Ctrl-C in the Xitami console 
window.
