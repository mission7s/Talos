Hi John, 

I have placed the latest executable of the RCLNPClientGUI under P:\Razor\RCL. The following functionalities are present in this version, available only in the RCL mode.

1. The User Interface mode - completed. 
2. The Packet Generator mode - completed. 
3. The Script Mode 
        
        The following commands are added in this version. 

        1) QC - QueryDestinationStatus 
        2) QD - QueryDestinationStatus 
        3) QJ - QueryDestinationStatus 
        4) QC_dst - QueryDestinationStatus 
        5) QD_dst - QueryDestinationStatus 
        6) QJ_dst - QueryDestinationStatus 
        7) QI - QueryDestinationStatus 
        8) Qi - QueryDestinationStatus 
        9) QC_area - QueryDestinationStatusforSpecificArea 
        10) QD_area - QueryDestinationStatusforSpecificArea 
        11) QJ_area - QueryDestinationStatusforSpecificArea 
        12) TA - TakeBreakawayByName 
        13) TJ - TakeBreakawayByIndex 

        Loop command support: 

        Added support for Loop Command. Loop Command takes loop count as an optional argument. 
        If loopcount is not specified, the commands are executed in an infinite loop. 

        The commands to be looped need to be specified between Loop and EndLoop as shown below. 

        Loop [,loopcount] 
        Command 1 
        Coomand 2 
        EndLoop 

        A sample script file with the commands listed above is attached for your reference.
